            <p>The Reference Data Manager (RDM) is a robust way of handling all of the behind-the-scenes concepts used in the CRHIM database. While creating new resources, or editing existing resources, you will notice that most data entry is done by selecting from predetermined dropdown lists, also known as <b>controlled vocabularies</b>. Controlled vocabularies ensure clean data, and the RDM is where you manage them.</p>
            <p>In the panel on the left, you can see the following four menus:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>Arches</b> menu holds <em>all</em> of the concept schemes in the database</li>
                <li>The <b>Dropdown Lists</b> menu holds the controlled vocabularies that are passed to the data input forms</li>
                <li>The <b>Entity Nodes</b> menu lists all of the entity nodes (types of information collected) present in the database</li>
                <li>The <b>Candidates</b> menu is used for more advanced procedures, and is not necessary for the actions described below</li>

            <p>Undoubtedly, new concepts will need to be added to the CRHIM in the future.  For example, you may find the need to add a new <b>Keyword</b> concept, so it can be associated with a new resource. The following steps will explain how to do so.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the <b>Arches</b> menu, scroll down and select the <b>Keyword</b> concept scheme. In the right panel, you can see all of the existing concepts in the Keyword concept scheme.</li>
                <li>Click the <b>Manage</b> menu, and select <b>Add Child</b>.</li>
                <li>Create a new Keyword ("Logging", for example) by entering it in the <b>Label</b> box. You can add a note to this concept if you like; it will be visible to anyone who views the concept in the RDM later.</li>
                <li>Click <b>Save Changes</b>. You have now added a new Keyword, and you'll see "Logging" in the list of Keyword concepts.</li>
                <li>Too add this new Keyword concept to the Keywords dropdown list (so it can be used in the creation of new resources), close the <b>Arches</b> menu, and open the <b>Dropdown Lists</b> menu.</li>
                <li>Scroll down to the <b>Keyword.E55</b> entry, and open that collection. You'll see the list of concepts that already exist in the dropdown.</li>
                <li>Click on <b>Add dropdown entry</b>, and begin to type "Logging". The new keyword will appear in the search bar, now that it has been added to the database (steps 1-4).</li>
                <li>Select the concept, and click <b>Save</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The new concept "Logging" will now be available to any Keyword dropdowns.</p>

                <h5>Adding an Alternate Label</h5>

            <p>In some cases, it may be desirable to use two completely different terms for a single concept, for example "post-in-ground" (English) and  "poteaux-en-terre" (French). To accommodate this, we can use the RDM to add extra labels to an existing concept. That way, searches or entries using either name will be treated the same.  The following steps will show how to add "poteaux-en-terre" as an alternate label for the concept "post-in-ground".</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the <b>Arches</b> menu, scroll down and select the <b>Construction Technique</b> concept scheme.</li>
                <li>Because "post-in-ground" has been classified as a subset of the more general "framing" category, click <b>Framing</b>.</li>
                <li>Now you can see the concept you're looking for, click on <b>post-in-ground</b>.</li>
                <li>Click <b>Add label</b>, and the Add Concept Label window will open.</li>
                <li>Simply type in <b>poteaux-en-terre</b>, and be sure to indicate that this is an <b>altLabel</b> ("alternate label"). Click <b>Save</b>.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Now, if a resource is entered that includes "post-in-ground" as a construction technique, a search for "poteaux-en-terre" will match it.</p>
