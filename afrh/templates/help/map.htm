            <p>The map has a single "basemap" layer underneath anything else in the view. You can switch between the standard roads and satellite imagery basemaps, as well as two others created specifically for the CRHIM. The full list of basemaps follows:<p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>Streets</b>, <b>Satellite</b>, and the <b>Streets & Satellite</b> basemaps are provided by <a href="http://www.bing.com/maps/" target="_blank">Bing Maps</a>.</li>
                <li>The <b>USGS 24k Topo</b> basemap (created from the <a href="http://nationalmap.gov/ustopo/about.html" target="_blank">USGS 1:24,000 map series</a>) is great for finding features from the past that do not show up on current basemaps maps, like the old Red Dirt Lookout Tower or the community of Mink.</li>
                <li>The <b>Shaded Relief</b> basemap shows a high-level of detail for all topographical features in Natchitoches Parish. This layer can be viewed in color or in grayscale (click the <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color: #65a5da;"></i> icon).</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em><b>NOTE:</b> Not all basemaps are supported at the highest zoom levels, and will activated/deactivated accordingly. If a basemap is not showing up at a high zoom level, zoom out until it does. You can also remove the basemap altogether.</em></p>

            <p>The ability to view historic maps is a very exciting feature of the CRHIM. These maps are presented here for research and general interest purposes, but the viewer must understand that the Cane River National Heritage Area makes no guarantee of their accuracy: <em><b>it is very easy to "over-interpret" historic maps!</b></em></p>
            <p>When a historic map is activated, it is added as a "layer" on top of the current basemap. You can "stack" multiple historic maps by activating more than one--the most recently activated map will be placed on top of any other historic maps. To further accommodate overlay comparisons, alternate color schemes have been enabled for a few of the historic maps. Click the <i class="fa fa-circle" style="color: #65a5da;"></i> icon to explore these options.</p>
            <p><em><b>NOTE:</b> Be sure to click on the <i class="fa fa-info-circle" style="color: #65a5da;"></i> icon to learn more about each historic map!</em></p>

            <p>In the Overlays tab, you can add CRHIM resources to the map. By default, a layer showing all resources is present.</p>
            <p>Once you have added a layer, you can adjust its transparency.</p>
            <p>In addition to the resource overlays, the following extra overlays have been added to the CRHIM:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Layers for vegetation in the American Cemetery</li>
                <li>Private property boundaries within Kisatchie National Forest</li>
                <li>Township/Range (PLSS) reference lines covering Natchitoches Parish</li>
