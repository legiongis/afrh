            <p>To search, simply begin typing any search term into the search bar below. As you type, you'll see a continuously updated list of potential matches. Each potential match will appear as a pair: 1. the value and 2. the database field where that value is found.</p>
            <p>For example, if you type in <b>hospital</b>, you'll see that you have a number of options, which should be interpreted like this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>hospital</b> as a <b>NHRP Resource Subcategory</b></li>
                <li><b>hospital</b> as a <b>Function</b></li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can narrow your search by adding as many additional search terms as necessary. For example, to find all of the 2-storey buildings, search 2 as a  You can remove a search term by clicking the <b>x</b>, or you can negate a search term--to show resources that <em>do not</em> fit the criterion--by clicking on it (it will turn red).</p>

            <p>In addition to combining multiple search terms, you can apply the Location Filter and/or Time Filter. Once enabled, these filters are added to the search bar, and can be negated just like any other search term.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>Location Filter</b> allows you to make a spatial query for resources. <em>What resources are within 500ft of the Sherman Building?</em> Use the <b>Map Tools</b> to create a point, line, or polygon on the map, and then apply a buffer to show resources that fit within a given distance of the shape. To create a line or polygon, click to create each new vertex, and double-click to finish the shape.</li>
                <li>The <b>Time Filter</b> allows you to make a date-based query for resources. <em>How many buildings were built before 1900?</em> Add some search terms and use the slider to narrow or broaden the range of dates.</li>

                <li>The <b>Related Resources</b> view is a very exciting feature of the Arches platform which allows you visualize relationships between database resources. You will see a graph that shows the current resource in the middle, with any relationships emanating from it. Search "Gilbert Cameron" for a great example of related resources.</li>
                <li>If a resource has coordinates, the <b>Map</b> button will open a map window and center it on your resource. You can activate the historic maps or change the basemaps to explore further.</li>
